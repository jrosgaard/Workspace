# Kirschner Panetta Tumor immunotherapy model

This project aimed to use a genetic algorithm to perform closed-loop optimization of immunotherapy dosing in the Kirschner-Panetta model. 

Using the slider notebook, you are able to adjust the antigenicity (c) for both the model without treatment and with the GA-optimized treatment regime.
